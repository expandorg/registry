# Registry Service
 
[Expand](https://expand.org) believes in decentralization of code and infrastructure. 3rd parties (companies, requesters, etc.) can replace internal Expand services used in task assignment, verification, etc. This repo allows 3rd parties to register their new services with Expand so they can work hand in hand with our system.

## FAQ
### What are services?
[Expand](https://expand.org) is a micro task marketplace. You can break down what Expand does into various domains including: task assignment, task verification, task eligibility, etc. Services are self-contained applications that can perform an action needed in the Expand ecosystem

### What is the purpose of this repo?
This repo is how we register services. [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7517177/SzKQzgQk)

### How does it work?

Each job can register its own external services. These services are stored as json, taking the following shape:

```
{
  "AssignmentValidator": {
    "url": "https://..."
  },
  "AssignmentCreator": {
    "url": "https://..."
  }  
}
```

## Getting started 

### Prerequisities:

- Install Go (On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.)
- [optional to debug] Postman

### Setup the project

Clone the repository with: 

`go get -u github.com/expandorg/registry`

OR 

create a directory `$GOPATH/src/github/expandorg` and execute: git clone git@github.com:expandorg/registry.git 

Run the project dependencies (db, etc.) with `make up`

Run the latest migration with `make migrate-latest`

Run the project with `make run`

### Dependencies

We use `dep` to manage our dependencies.

To add a new vendor, use: 

`deps ensure -add DEPENDENCY`

To update vendors for built project, run:

`make update-deps`

## Database

### Add a new migration

```make add-migration name="migration_name"```

For migration names be descriptive and start with verbs: `create_`, `drop_`, `add_`, etc.

This will look at the latest migrated version (1, 2, 3) and creates 2 files with new version:

`2_migration_name.up.sql` and `2_migration_name.down.sql`

### Migrate

You can migrate to latest:

```make migrate-latest```

OR 

You can migrate up and migrate down a version:

```make run-migrations action="goto" version="1"```

When you migrate up, you can see in the `schema_migrations` the last migrated version. When you migrate down, it updates the the version column in `schema_migrations`.

## Tests
```make run-tests```

### Unit tests
We keep all unit tests close to the code and withing the same package. For example, if you want to test the service package, then you would add the tests in that folder marked `package service`.

### Functional

We keep all functional tests in `tests/` folder. Create a new test file for every function. 

## CI / CD
We use Google Cloud for CI/CD:

*note: please don't modify the following files unless you know what you're doing :)*

**cloudbuild.yaml:** this effectively our CI, it run tests on every PR and will âœ“ or x.

**cloudbuild.cd.yaml:** this effectively our CD, it run tests, builds and pushes the image to the container registry and deploys to production on every Master commit, so master has to be always clean. 

**k8s.yaml:** this is the kubernetes setup, including workload and service setup. cloudbuild.cd uses this file to deploy.
